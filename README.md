### Title: Exploring the Relationship Between Flight Traffic Information and Air Quality

## Objectives:
- Combine datasets on flight traffic information and air quality
- Explore the relationship between flight frequency and local air pollution levels
- Track this trend over time
- Did COVID reduce air traffic â€“ and potentially improve air quality?
- Focus analysis on US, not global data
- 
## Potential Datasets:
- Openflights.org
